  <h4> About this website </h4>
    <p> Welcome to my website. It was written in HTML code. I have five sites, all of which were created with <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix.com</a>, the free website builder. This website is a homepage for all my other sites, and its purpose is a school assignment in HTML, hence why this site is not built using Wix.com.</p>
